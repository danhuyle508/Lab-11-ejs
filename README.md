# Google Books Search App
**Author**: Milo Anderson and Dan-Huy Le
**Version**: 1.0.4

## Overview 

This simple app allows users to search the Google Books API & browse the results. It displays resulting titles, authors, images, and descriptions

## Getting Started

After you clone the repo, you will need to run "npm install" in your terminal to install the required dependencies. You'll also want to create a .env file and add a PORT number, e.g. "PORT=3000"

## Architecture

The app relies on express.js to route client requests and read query data, superagent.js to communicate with the Google Books API, and EJS to render the results on an html page
